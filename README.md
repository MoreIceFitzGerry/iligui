Development of an understandable Graphical User Interface to simplify the usage of INTERLIS Data und Tools for Users.

## Background
INTERLIS appeared in 1991 as a description language for spatial data and as a mechanism for data exchange. The name comes from the abbreviation INTER or BETWEEN land information systems. The language is intended to ensure long-term compatibility among different systems. (Fachgruppe Geo-normen et al. 2017) Since 2008, it has been legally specified in the Swiss Geoinformation Act.

To facilitate the work with INTERLIS for all parties involved, some reference documents as well as software tools are provided on the official INTERLIS website. (Rolf ZÃ¼rcher, swisstopo/KOGIS) This range of software tools are developed for a professional audience, whereby their user interface is not the main focus. Although the language now includes some documentation, most tools are pure command line programs with somewhat limited documentation of practical examples. (Bereuter 2023)

In a bachelor thesis of the FHNW Muttenz, a new user interface for the software tools will be created to make it easier to use for existing users and thus expand the target audience.
